# Contributing

WISDAM welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!

If you are not a developer, there are many other possibilities that do not require programming skills to help WISDAM to evolve.
You can also contribute by:
* extending the manual
* develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials
* providing datasets
* participating in discussions
* help with outreach and onboard new contributors
* **write grant proposals and help with other fundraising efforts**

## Contribution to WISDAMcore
The [WISDAMcore](https://github.com/WISDAMapp/WISDAMcore) package is the mathematical core behind WISDAM. 

WISDAMcore is dealing with all the **direct-georeferencing - mapping - photogrammetry**.

We are also seeking for contributors to that package.

## Bug reporting and bug fixing

You can help us **by submitting bug reports or fixing bugs** in the [WISDAM bug tracker](https://github.com/WISDAMapp/WISDAM/issues/).

## New features and enhancements

If you wish to contribute patches you can:

1. [fork the project](https://help.github.com/forking/)
2. make your changes
3. commit to your repository
4. and then [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

 The development team can then review your contribution and commit it upstream as appropriate.

If you commit a new feature, add `[FEATURE]` to your commit message AND give a clear description of the new feature. 

For large-scale changes, you should first open a [discussion topic](https://github.com/WISDAMapp/WISDAM/discussions/categories/ideas).
